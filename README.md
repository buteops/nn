## fromtenets: from neural nets to mlops

> [!IMPORTANT]
> the way to learn are from books to implementations. Target 50 books

All code are written with plain python (.py), you must know about Modular Programming. All Production-Ready are used as feature with API behaviour (more or less). You think notebook are served to production-use?

### Need an Advice?
