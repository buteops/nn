> Approximately 2 hours/day to learn or update some implementations. On my calender is set from 5.00 - 7.00, but if i still as a morning person.

## The Hopes
- What is `'Machine Learning'` or `'Artificial Intelligence'` in general and productions.
- Operations for Implementations
- Well, just my preferable ways to learn for the swe + ml/ops + devops in programmic way.
- can be maintainble as Open Source, specifically for Indonesian Developers
- Critical Thinking > Traditional Thinking
- Library?? we will see ;)

## The Progressive Dirs
1. `docs`: Some interesting parts of resources will be surf on internet.
2. `examples`: Not just learn the basics, but completely true that must used to real use-case examples.
3. `extra`: some very useful, some not really.
4. `mlopsency`: MLOps Frontend for Dummies. The hopes of future library
5. `test`: we need TDD implementations for some sources so it'll clean and maintainable.
